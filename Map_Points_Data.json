It lies at the foot of a ridge of high mountains, called the Sierra Nevada, or Mountain of Snow. So great is their height that even in the intense heat of summer they are covered in snow. In front of the city stretches an immense plain called the Vega, at least 20 miles in length, highly cultivated, and, although it is still winter with you at home, here the spring is far advanced. So hot is the sun during the day that I cannot stand to sketch for ten minutes together, but am obliged to cross into the shade. On a hill immediately above Granada rises the old Moorish palace of the Alhambra, a great part of which is in the most perfect preservation. Courts, halls, terraces, galleries, and fountains out of number are here, and golden fish still disport themselves in the numerous ponds. The gardens are filled with orange and lemon trees laden with fruit, and even at this early season the flowers are in full bloom and beauty. \n\nLetter dated February 13, 1833\n \nBoth published in: James Ballantine, <i>The Life of David Roberts, R.A.: Compiled from His Journals and Other Sources</i>, 1866                                                         \n",

It is entered through a small court, where we noticed a window divided by a slender column, from which there is a view of the hill of the Alhambra.

Narrow streets, squalid old houses, old women dozing on the doorsteps, mothers carefully inspecting their children\u2019s heads, gaping dogs, crowing cocks, ragged boys running and shouting, and the other things that one always sees in the suburbs; but in those streets nothing more. But gradually, as we ascended, the appearance of the houses and the people began to change; the roofs became lower, the windows fewer, the doors smaller, and the people more ragged. In the middle of every street ran a little stream in a walled gutter in the Moorish style; here and there over the doors and around the windows one saw the remains of arabesques and fragments of columns, and in the corners of the squares fountains and well-curbs of the time of the Moorish dominion. At every hundred steps it seemed as if we had gone back fifty years toward the age of the caliphs. \n\nEdmondo De Amicis, <i>Spain and the Spaniards</i>, 1895                                                                                                                 \n",

On the western terrace stands the Alhambra, its base washed by the Darro. On the eastern one stand the Vermilion Towers, beyond which the land slopes more gently down into the precincts of the town of Granada. These two terraces were formerly girt with walls and towers and connected together with winding lanes; and within the circuit thus fortified, stood the palaces and villas of the Caliphs of Granada, as well as their chief fortresses; so many that the enclosure was called a city.\n\nSusan Hale, <i>A Family Flight Through Spain</i>, 1883                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
