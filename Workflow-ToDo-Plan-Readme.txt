- Project to-do list on Todoist (app and website)

Next Steps (Current Point):
1.) Figure out how to get proper popups from points, same as in the previous iteration of site
2.) Import all the data points from the previous iteration of site
3.) Test how site works with any .json file
	- Spread out points
	- Heavy load of points

Planned Features:
1.) Popups include more pictures of painting and location
	- May or may not have their own text
		- if (picture.hastext())
			painting.text = picturetext
	- Accessable through a scrollbar at bottom of popup (see wireframe drawing)
2.) Popups include adjacent points
	- Accessable through a scrollbar at bottom of popup (see wireframe drawing)
	- Changing paintings in popup changes point opened on map as well
3.) Edit popup design
	- BG Transparency
	- Clarity
		- Exit button, text visibility, etc.
	- Positioning
	- Whole Screen vs. Small Popup
		- May require bootstrap
4.) Edit point / cluster design
	- Clarity
	- Nicer colors
	- Background polygons
5.) Home Page / Landing Screen
	- Home page with info about the project(s) to access the map from
	- May require bootstrap
6.) Improve quality of maps, overlays, etc.
